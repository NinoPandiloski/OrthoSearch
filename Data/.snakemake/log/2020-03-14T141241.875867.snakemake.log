ImproperOutputException in line 24 of /export/home/bio1901/Documents/29_BINP/Project/Data/Trysnake:
Outputs of incorrect type (directories when expecting files or vice versa). Output directories must be flagged with directory(). for rule find_orthologs:
Results/2_Orthologs/PB
Removing output files of failed job find_orthologs since they might be corrupted:
Results/2_Orthologs/PB
Terminating processes on user request, this might take some time.
Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 24 of /export/home/bio1901/Documents/29_BINP/Project/Data/Trysnake:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
Results/2_Orthologs/HT
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
