Error in rule find_orthologs:

    output: Results/2_Orthologs/PB
    shell:
        
		busco -m protein -i Results/1_GeneSequences/PB.faa -o PB -l plasmodium_odb10
		mv PB Results/2_Orthologs
		mv busco_downloads Results/2_Orthologs
		
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job find_orthologs since they might be corrupted:
Results/2_Orthologs/PB
Skipped removing non-empty directory Results/2_Orthologs/PB
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
